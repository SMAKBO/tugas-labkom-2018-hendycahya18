The properties of formic acid
Physical Properties
The liquid is colorless, it smells sharp, and dissolves perfectly in water. 
This great solubility is caused because formic acid contains hydroxyl groups, -OH which can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. 
In addition, the absence of an alkyl chain in formic acid causes this compound to be most water soluble compared to other carboxylic acids, since essentially the alkyl chain is hydrophobic (dislikes water).
Formic acid can also damage the skin.</p>
