<h1>THE DANGER</h1>
<p>The danger of formic acid depends on its concentration. At higher concentrations, formic acid is corrosive, has a strong odor and produces hazardous smoke. This material produces burns and abrasions on the skin and injures the eyes and mucous membranes in the mouth, throat and respiratory system. Inhaling the concentrated formic acid makes breathing difficult. Swallowing concentrated acid causes severe magh (wounds) to appear in the gastrointestinal tract as well as pain and nausea. Prolonged exposure to formic acid may cause liver or kidney damage.
