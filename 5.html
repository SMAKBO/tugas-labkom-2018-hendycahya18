	Since formic acid is an antibacterial agent, it is often added to animal feed to prevent bacterial growth. This substance is also sometimes used as a preservative of human food. Formic acid is also used to create artificial flavors for food and drinks and artificial flavors for perfume. In addition, formic acid is used in tannery, in textile and paper processing and in latex conversion from rubber tree to rubber.
Some birds place ants alive among their feathers, a behavior known as earrings. Ants are very frequent, but not always animal ants from members of the formicinae subfamily also exist. Scientists do not know why birds use ants. According to one theory, formic acid released by ants kills mites that attack the skin of birds. Humans use formic acid for the same purpose, namely formic acid used to kill varroa mites and trachea that attack the honeycomb that attacks the bees.
