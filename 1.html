<h1>DEFINITION</h1>
<p>

The word formiat comes from the Latin word, a kind of red ant name formica rufa which can secrete acid and form as free acid. It has a systematic name that is Metamoric Acid. Formic acid is naturally present in bee sting and ant, so it is also known as acid ant. Formic acid is an important intermediate compound in many chemical syntheses. Formic acid chemical formulas can be written as HCOOH or CH2O2.

In nature, formic acid produced many insects from the Hymenoptera, for example bees and ants as a tool of attack or defensive devices. Formic acid is also the result of significant combustion of alternative fuels, ie burning methanol (and water-mixed ethanol), when mixed with gasoline. The name of the formic acid comes from the Latin word formica which means "ant". Initially, the compound is isolated by an ant distillation. Ants produce this acid in a sac called acidophore. If the ant "bites" (actually clamped), it is also an acidic acidic acid fungicide from acidophore to strengthen the pain of the victim. Formic acid derived chemical compounds, eg salt groups and esters, are called formats or metanoates. The format ion has a HCOO-chemical formula.

This acid is commonly found in several plant species, in the nettle hairs and the result of 	
bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates. Some scientists conduct research related to the formic 	
acid of the ants. Brunfles at the beginning of the 16th century investigated the steam from 	
mountain ants causing the red color of the plants. Et-Muller in 1684 has distilled a number of 	
mountain ants to produce an "acid spirit" which can damage the iron. Fisher distilled a number 	o
f ants with water and was found in a distillate solution of an acid resembling "spirit of v	inegar". Generally, formic acid sold in the market has levels of 85% and 90% while in the form 	of anhydrous is available in free amounts. Formic acid is widely used for rubber coagulants, 	conditioners in textile dyeing, leather industry and synthesis of pharmaceutical ingredients and 	other chemicals.
