<p>Chemical Properties
The chemical properties of this formic acid are the strongest acids of other carboxylic acids, with pKa of 3.75%, and having acid and aldehyde groups. Formic acid is called the strongest acid because it has no alkyl chain. With thsejarah e longer alkyl chain on the carboxylic acid compound, the acidity decreases.

Reaction of Ants
In addition, mydahic acid formats undergo oxidation reactions with powerful oxidizers such as KmnO4 producing CO2 gas and brown deposits of MnO2. The equation of the reaction is as follows:
Formic acid may be used include:
3HCOOH + 2MnO4 â†’ 3CO2 + 2MnO2 + 2OH- + 2H2O</p>
